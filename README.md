Okay this is a simple NextJS app with the log parser in the lib folder, adapted to work with more 
than one log file. That functionality is tested as well.

First of all clone this rep, then run 

```npm install```

If you want to check the tests just run

```npm test```

To check the front-end type this, just be warned that I didn't put too much work on that so I could
send this on time, but it could be easily transformed into something else

```npm run dev```
